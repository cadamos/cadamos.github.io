summary: A simple webpage design for my Netprep Website Design class (DMED 121) on a faux restaurant menu.
---

As one of the final project of my Netprep Website Design class, we had to create a simple webpage design on a restaurant using Adobe Dreamweaver. We created a homepage with a simple bio on the restaraunt as shown below:

Then we created a Menu page showcasing all the food and beverage items available at the Cafe, along with a short description and price of the menu item. The text was preset, however, we used HTML/CSS to design the overall look and layout of the page:

Lastly, we had to created a short testimonial page including one "review" of the restaurant:

I've also included an external link to their actual "website" (provided to us by the textbook), however, it no longer exists.

This project has helped me strengthen my HTML/CSS abilities. My DMED 121 class's primary focus was on developing our coding skills with focus on the design aspect of it. I've learned basic HTML/CSS formatting and incorporated it into Adobe Dreamweaver, also learning how to publish it onto the web. 

The website for the page can be found <a href ="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~cadamos/dmed121/project_05/testimonials.html">here</a>.
