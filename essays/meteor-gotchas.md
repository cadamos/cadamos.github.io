<p>Ah, Meteor.</p>

<p>There's a lot that can be said about a personâ€™s first experience with Meteor. Like with all things, experiencing a new platform for coding can always be really exciting and really nerve wracking at the same time. From my limited two weeks of experience, I, alongside of a few of my classmates I'm assuming, have run into a few bumps along the road. Of all the troubles that I personally have come across, two problems seemed to be at the top of that mountain: Building and Syntax.</p>

<p>The first and arguably the biggest problem that most students have come across with Meteor has to be the speed of building. I personally have one of the older MacBooks. Usually, it isn't much of a problem because at the end of the day, it gets the job done. However, Meteor has a way of testing your patience when it comes to running Meteor on a MacBook like mine. When starting Meteor, my Mac can take upwards of about 15 minutes to SOLELY get started. I do believe that there are other factors that come into play when it comes to the speed of Meteor running but the main reason would have to be the speed of my machine. It posed one of the biggest problems for me because to do any assignment in class, I would spend 75% of my time just waiting for it to start, consequently making it have me spend more time on assignments and WODs(Timed class assessments) than I'd like to. My solution to this problem was a quick one: Borrow another machine. Then, later on through the semester, I do plan on making improvements on my own machine to make my Meteor experience a little more speedier and tolerable.</p>

<p>Second, would have to be the Syntax. This problem isn't as big as the first solely because every programmer experiences this with any new platform of coding that they learn. As expected, time will be spent learning how to properly code certain things using a different method. Doing an if-statement in Java is going to be different when doing an if-statement in Meteor because of the different style the program offers to code in. For example, I'm very much used to the plain ol': "if (something) { some form of code here } else {do some other form of code here}". This is the basic form of an if-statement in most coding platforms. In Meteor, there is a slight difference. Instead, they are done using double curly braces, and closing if and else statements. So the same thing would be said like: {{if}} some code here {{/if}} {{else}} some other code here {{/else}}". Although not a big deal, there is still an adjustment period that takes some getting used to. This problem can only be solved in time. Once the muscle memory kicks in and we all get comfortable using this new Syntax, we will be able to functionally code in Meteor in no time.</p>

<p>Although some problems are present, it isn't anything that can't be solved. Meteor does has its benefits such as live-restarting that is a huge help when checking to see if a code works. It cuts back time that would be spent having to save and publish online and does all that hard work for you. Which ultimately is worth the few bumps in the road.</p>
